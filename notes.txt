general q's:
where are the drill holes?
	-all the yellow filled circles

what input are we getting since motors are bidirectional
are the auxillary motors for steering
	-they are currently immaginary. For the time being, we will only be physically connecting 2 motos but we are adding in the capacity to connect 2 more future motors


clarrify requirement 7, 3v3 in?
	-similar to breadboard power sub system - just need to provide output 	pins




report:
block diagram: transfer behaviour shown in blocks and signals ( 3v3 input, DC ) shown with lines 

interface diagram: analogous to programming: shows what are data types passed into and out of function
with hardware - need to show what voltages go in and out, what signals, etc



bread board memo:

boost converter since linear voltage regulators have a minimum input that they regulate from

each motor has 2 physical connectors
